# F1FeederApp - a sports feed app for F1 racing

F1FeederApp uses the angular-seed project as it not only provides with a great skeleton for bootstrapping, but also sets the ground for unit testing.

I am using an autosport API service to act as our back-end. Ergast is providing a free motorsport API that will be perfect for this app.


## angular-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.

### I am developing this app as a learning tutorial of AnguarJS
